What is "funny"? And how do we use that word in our everyday conversations?

Funny is subjective. What's funny to me might not be funny to you. Have you seen "Kazoo Kid Trap Remix"? I think it's one of the crowning achievements of the digital age. But my wife? Not so much. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/79accf0e-a9cf-4639-920f-03bf2f8fad9b.gif)

Funny is contextual. It requires that you have knowledge of a situation in order to find it funny. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fa83e8ef-443e-464f-8190-05737967dee9.gif)

But sometimes, funny is just how a reaction strikes you in the moment.   
Funny is temporal.   
Funny can be a lot of things.

So, what's funny to you? It's is edgy, slightly-not-appropriate humor?  
Classic slapstick? British-dry-sarcasm? Highly contextual/referential?  
"Funny" is dependent on who we are and what we've experienced.
